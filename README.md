# Calculator App

SPA developed with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) using [VueCLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

## Libraries

* To handle most of the math, [math.js](https://mathjs.org/) was used.
* [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/) was used to do the tag-structure and the buttons.
* The other part of the style was made with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) using [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax).
